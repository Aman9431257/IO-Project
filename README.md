# IO-Project
IO Project is a browser-based, real-time multiplayer general knowledge game designed for fast, fun, and competitive learning. It’s inspired by classic `.io` principles — instant play, social competition, lightweight design — but focuses on *intellectual reflexes* rather than action or physics.
